This is an update to @TeeDeeY's plugin enabling copy/paste of time signatures in MuseScore. Their version
wasn't working for me in MuseScore 4.xx so I decided to update it. However, I ended up adding a significant
number of new features, making the plugin useful for composers/arrangers working with music that frequently
changes time signatures, especially recurring multi-measure time-signature sequences (i.e. recurring instances
of 5/8+6/8, etc)

NEW FEATURES:

- Allows saving/loading of multiple-time signature sequences within one score file (i.e., user can store 5/8+6/8, 3/4+5/8,
and load each for use at any point while working in the file, via drop-down menu). Note these are preserved with the
score file and do not transfer if the plugin is opened on another Musescore file.

- Preserves numerators in additive meters (i.e. 2+3/8 pastes as 2+3/8, not 5/8, as in @TeeDeeY's original plugin)

- Via 'Clipboard mode,' users can copy/paste time-signature changes across files.
